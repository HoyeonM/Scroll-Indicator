            It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills
            when Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself,
            yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of
            the sleepy feeling in their tips.  <br>
             Mother Wolf lay with her big
            gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and
            the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived.
            "Augrh!" said Father Wolf.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is time to hunt again."  He was going to spring down hill
            when a little shadow with a bushy tail
            crossed the threshold and whined: "Good luck go with you, O Chief
            of the Wolves. <br> And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble
            children that they may never forget the hungry in this world."
        </p>
           
        
        <p>
            It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the
            wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making
            mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather
            from the village rubbish-heaps. <br>
            But they are afraid of him too,
            because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go
            mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone, and
            runs through the forest biting everything in his way.<br>
            Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is
            the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature.  We
            call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the madness--
            and run.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Enter, then, and look," said Father Wolf stiffly, "but there
            is no food here."
        </p>

        <p>
            "For a wolf, no," said Tabaqui, "but for so mean a person as
            myself a dry bone is a good feast. <br> Who are we, the Gidur-log [the
            jackal people], to pick and choose?"  He scuttled to the back of
            the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it,
            and sat cracking the end merrily.
        </p>

        <p>
            "All thanks for this good meal," he said, licking his lips.
            "How beautiful are the noble children! <br> How large are their eyes!
            And so young too!  Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that
            the children of kings are men from the beginning."
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing
            so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces.  It pleased
            him to see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made,
            and then he said spitefully:
        </p>

        <p>
            "Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds.  He
            will hunt among these hills for the next moon, so he has told me."
        </p>

        <p>
            Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River,
            twenty miles away.
        </p>

        <p>
            "He has no right!" Father Wolf began angrily--"By the Law
            of the Jungle he has no right to change his quarters without due
            warning.  He will frighten every head of game within ten miles,
            and I--I have to kill for two, these days."
